{"0": "Got defective piece the screen was clicking on the left bottom corner and one of the screw seems out as well out of the box pics are attached .I have already returned it for replacement but it seems like a long process not happy at all.Another thing I came to notice was something written on back of the phone (Self Declaration -conforming to IS) which is not there in my friends iPhone 6 which was bought from retail shop pic are attached if anyone could help me out what it is would be helpful thanks .", "1": "This is my third device from Apple and the first iPhone.Usually i use to stick with android and windows.This is the first time i am buying iPhone for my personal use.Though i have used all of the  previous iPhones that my friends or relatives own.Never bought iPhone,maybe because of the smaller screen size as i prefer something more than 4.5inch.I have no plans to write an in-depth review because there are tons of reviews available on YouTube,reviewing sites etc.So,in this review i would point out my experience ,as a newbie with iPhone.First of all, You may see a lot of reviews claiming that they got bricks,soap,chips and other low end mobiles when they ordered iPhone.These are the reason why it happens:1-They may have ordered it from a \"NON-Amazon fulfilled\" seller or it is \"Seller Fulfilled\" item.2-If they have ordered it from Amazon fulfilled seller then it may be done by courier service guys.3-The most common thing that usually happen in online purchase is--------- People trying to take advantage of the user friendly amazon policies.  FOR EXAMPLE: A person orders  a 40k INR iPhone,get it delivered.Opens the box and its the same iPhone.But that fellow makes a false claim that he/she got a brick or old damaged phone.Making amazon the culprit.In this case amazon have no other way ,than returning the money and taking the brick or old phone as return.AND The customer now got a new 40k INR iPhone for FREE.I order it from a Amazon fulfilled seller(Can't name the seller,as people may think I'm biased towards them) .And got a fully functional iPhone.#***So make sure to order it from a Amazon fulfilled seller.Here is the full list.  http://goo.gl/wktuhFNow my experience with it (PROS + CONS)--------------------------------------- Display is superior and of Top-notch quality. Definitely a smaller version of the Retina display on Macbook Pro.-Sound quality is really stellar.Audio is clear and crisp,will recommend a Bluetooth speaker for better experience.-4.7 inch is just perfect for me,for a single handed use and for my jeans pocket.-Talking about the jeans pocket-\"Yes,the protruding camera really act as a hurdle when i try to put it in my jeans pocket\".-its really slim and one of the slimmest and lightest phone i have ever used.-Call quality is satisfactory,there was no call drop.Nothing as an issue-Camera is pretty good in every lighting condition.Apple is surely not in a race for MEGAPIXEL.Rather they have optimized the software so good,that the 8MP sensor is enough to give other flagships a tough competition.takes some awesome pics and videos.Snaps them real quick.-Battery backup is loving.Never got such kinda battery performance from my previous android phones.- Rounded edges make many cases very easy to slip off, or at least not fit as snug as they otherwise could.(Maybe the case that i order was faulty)-The screen response is perfect and the thumb print works 90% of the time and is really convenient to get into the phone.-It is fast opening and closing apps, websites, etc-Android users may find the \"back button\" on top  really inconvenient.As i would have preferred that at bottom side.-The Command Center is nice,useful at times.-Also the mail app is real good to work with.But still i prefer the Outlook one.-No button to clear all notification.Expecting that in upcoming updates.-Nothing much of a lagging that usually occurs in Android.And no app crashes yet.-App store have everything i need.Nice to see that ,there are no junk or useless app (Playstore is flooded with them) .-But most of the apps are paid, Though they are worth for the money.-Lot more to discover,will keep this review updated.So,is it worth the buy------------------------------Yes,you will love it.Unless you get a faulty one.So, the iPhone 6 is a very cool device. For everyday use like email,Internet etc.And pretty much everything you need from a smartphone without sacrificing the quality.Also the after sales service of APPLE is well known.So,no doubt about that.I hope you find my review helpful", "2": "I am still awaiting the product to reach me, its outrageous that i have received a box filled with stones instead.", "3": "Its been more than two months since i have been using this phone and now I can provide a detailed description of this phone.I have divided this review into 5 segments which for most should cover the aspects about buying a new smartphone.1) Design/Build Quality-I have to say Apple gets the credit here. This device is a sheer engineering masterpiece. From its smooth corners to its rounded edges there's just one complete continuous surface which makes it a joy to hold.And that 129g gets so evenly distributed over the palm that it just feels lighter than anything. Though I have to mention here that it's a bit slippery to hold. The sturdy construction combined with choice of materials makes it the best looking phone In the market.2) Specs/Perfomance-For those spec enthusiasts out there it might feel quite low and unsatisfying considering the hefty amount tag it carries.But trust me even with 1 gig of ram combined with A8 processor this smartphone performs like no other. There are only a few phones out there that match its level of sustained performance throughout from opening multiple apps to playing graphic intense games. And in the end specs don't matter its the performance that counts which is really excellent.3)Camera-The 8 megapixel iSight shooter seems too little compared to some of those of androids. Shots taken in good lighting conditions are just great and a lot detailed. But when it comes to low light conditions the camera is left behind in the competition. Zoomed in photos in low light are a little disappointing at such price point.The front camera is just fine for selfies. The slow mo is at 240fps is an interim ting feature. Overall the camera is good but could have been improved a little.4)Operating System- IOS 8 just almost same as iOS 7 with a minor changes including health app and it works well and is lag free. The App Store provides all necessary apps for free and the quality of apps is better than that of the android. The only niggle here is that many of the apps aren't customised for larger screen and they kinda look unpleasant to eyes compared to the others.5)Battery-This is the part where the iPhone 6 is lacking. This is a sort of consequence of that thin design. A battery of 1810mAh isn't completely powerful enough to make it last more than a day. By the time you are at bed you have to plug in the charger.A moderate to heavy usage including browsing safari checking mails using whatsapp Facebook listening to some music will drain the battery before night and if a lot of gaming is being done then don't expect much.This phone is undoubtedly one of the best phones in the market at this time. Some areas like the camera and battery should have been better but seeing the android market in 2014 and the overall performance it delivers I should say its tough to point a phone better than it.", "4": "I bought this product on feb 2015 and suddenly charger stop working. I visited i store in surat they told me that this charger is duplicate.  so beware of duplicate.", "5": "I received 2nd hand damaged one.", "6": "The phone arrived without accessories on complaining they didn't bother answering properly. Seems to be their USP for selling cheap iPhones.I would insist rather move to another online portals where the complaints are heard and resovled.", "7": "Apple now offers three sizes, 16GB 64GB and 128GB. This is good because my 64gb iphone 5 barely made it at times. I love clicking pictures and videos. It is fun to document things with a camera as good as the one on the iPhone. Don't believe what you might have heard, Apple iPhone has the best primary camera. The front facing camera is a little sharper than my iPhone 5 but overall nothing special because it is about 1.2 megapixel. I don't know understand why Apple doesn't go the HTC way and have a bigger front facing camera.Keep in mind I am an Apple iPhone user coming to another iPhone. I understood that the differences would be there but was not prepared to be underwhelmed by finding the same phone with just a bigger screen and only a few changes. Slightly better camera, thinner phone, larger screen, same iOS 8, same call handling, smooth performance I am used to. One must understand that it is difficult to make an iPhone better because it is already good. I would pick my old iPhone 5 over the existing brigade of Samsung phones. I even tried the S5.Anyway to better highlight and compare my review, I will tell you features that have improved, what I dislike and what should have been, whether its worht your money or not.Changes I like -a) The call handling facility of the iPhone 6 is definitely superior, free flowing and easier than the iPhone 5. I don't know how they did this but things just flow seemelessly when you're on a call, there is a level of control in the handheld which even the wonderful iPhone 5 didn't have. I don't know if you will notice in a hurry.b) The curved display feels amazing to touch. On the right and left hand side where the bezel exists there is a very smooth glassy touch. And its fun to scroll left and right. Yes, this does make it more difficult for cases such as the one Spigen offers to be installed on your phone, it overall feels amazing and smooth.c) The power button has now shifted to the right. This takes roughly a day or two to get used to because instinctively you will now go to the placement on the right hand side.d) The speaker is a bit louder. The battery is lasting me 20 hours as compared to 14 hours on my iPhone 5 [ios8]*Suggestion* Use battery doctor and ensure you never unplug your phone before 100% of charge. Invest in a portable battery solution.Every new battery is better than an old battery so it remains to be seen. Am I completely happy with it? Not really. It could have been better.e) The finger print scanner makes life better.CONS -a) no premium earphones, same old same old, this is very cheap considering Apple charges 70 grand for a 128gb phone.b) The camera has been 8 megapixel for over four generations now. This is a big downer.c) Not water resistantd) NFC can only be used for Apple Pay (who cares)e) Battery could have been a bit bigger, they could have made the phone a little thicker, that way it would serve very wellf) iTunes syncing is not easy and has become horrible ever since I invested in iTunes Match.g) iOS 8 is Apple's weakest release in recent years. The out of box version is 8.0 so don't be stunned if your phone is HEATING your hands. Please update immediately. This is so unprofessional though. Imagine a person who can't access internet or doesn't know how to upgrade. They will all face a heating issue? Rubbish.Conclusion - Since its been less than a week, I think I am daily discovering changes which although are very diminutive will eventually go a long way in making for a better upgrade.If you have an iPhone 5 that is remotely defective or running iOS 8 - get this phoneIf you are satisfied with your iPhone 5 running ios 7 - stick with it until something better comes alongIf you have an android, close your eyes and buy this phone, you will love this as your first iPhone.Which color to buy? BLACK (SPACE GREY). Ever noticed that your tv has black edges? Its because black gives the best potential display without causing a disturbance or confusion for our eyes to focus.", "8": "I switched from android to apple this time...and not regrating my decision...such a fluent performance...amazing product.....those who are in doubt that online product are genuine or not....IT IS GENUINE AND COMES WITH A ONE YEAR OF PRODUCT WARRANTY....HOWEVER ORIGINAL BILL OF PURCHASING NOT CAME WITH THE PRODUCT. I REQUESTED AMAZON TO SEND, HOPE THEY WILL SEND.SCREEN -5/5BATTERY -4/5PERFORMENCE -5/5DAILY TASK-5/5Last mobile i used was note 3 neo.. And ios simply awesome..go for it.", "9": "The phone is amazing. Works well! Might be a little difficult to use with just one hand even though the app comes down the screen with double tap option... Altogether i loved it! Amazon delivered it quickly and well packed!"}
