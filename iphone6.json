This is my first apple iphone and it is very amazing phone very stylish, very light & very comfortable. all features are amazing but i am very impressed with its sound quality. only one disadvantage in this phone and that is it is too much costly.\n\t\t\t\t", "5": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe feeling of un boxing it and switching it on for the first time is something in itself! You will be surprised to find it so light compared to its screen size. Amazingly smooth and has a much better battery life. Charges faster if you use an ipad charger with it. The double tap for accessibility is great and very useful. The camera does far better than its predecessor. You will love it when you own it. \n\t\t\t\t", "6": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReplaced my Iphone 5s with New Iphone 6. This year again purchased my iphone from Flipkart & as always delivery was up-to the mark.

Amazing interface - Apple has always kept it clean2. Outstanding camera3. Outstanding premium looks4. Amazing ecosystem, in case you also have a Mac/iPad these devices interconnect seamlessly through iCloud5. Awesome screen (All that Gorilla Glass and so on fade away against the vibrancy of this phone's screen - Don't understand the gimmick of having to play Full-HD videos on phone, the screen's too small to make out the difference)Cons:1. There is no 32gb version but that's fine, mostly we use Google Drive and iCloud nowadays2. Size - Yes, it is a small issue, a 4\" phone is way better to use in one hand than a 4.7\" but this con is simply overshadowed by the sheer performance of this phoneBiggest Pro: It comes in Gold color - extremely popular among Women, and my Wife loved it.Last but not the least - Ordered this on Same Day delivery and Flipkart's service delivery simply added the icing on the cake. Flipkart is flawless.\n (Expand)\n"}
